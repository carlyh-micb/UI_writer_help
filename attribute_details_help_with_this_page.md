# Attribute Details

On the attribute details page you can edit properties of each attribute present in your schema.

# Attribute Name
You can edit each attribute name, and reorder the attributes.

# Flagged
Flagged attributes are where you can specify Flagged Attribute for sensitive data (e.g. names of people, government identification, birth date etc.). Marking an entry with a check will allow you to flag any attributes where identifying information about entities may be captured. 

Flagging an attribute acts as an alert to data users to treat the data as high-risk throughout the data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage.
