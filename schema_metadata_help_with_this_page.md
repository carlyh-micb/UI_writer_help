# Schema Metadata

# Attributes
This list of attributes was generated either manually, or read from an uploaded dataset. If these attribute labels need to be changed you will be able to do this on the next pages.

# Schema Description

The OCA language for writing schemas lets users easily add multiple language support to their schemas. By default the schema begings with English language where you can add a schema title and description. The title and description should help anyone find and use your schema to help them understand how to interpret an associated dataset.
